As an open-source project, contributions from all are welcome! Please note
that this project is focussed on parsing files in the [ATCO-CIF](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/c1acee5b-a400-46bd-a795-9bf7637ff879/resource/6fba35d3-b59c-4eaa-925f-e3dbaa1ea168/download/atco-cif-spec1.pdf)
format.

Contributions are more than welcome under the Apache 2.0 license. Please raise
a pull request directly with any contributions you might like to make. If you
feel your contribution is large or may be controversial, please feel free to
raise an issue in GitHub first to discuss it.
 
Even if you can't contribute code, 

Developing with the code should be familiar to JavaScript developers, simply
check out the code and then run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to fetch all
the dependencies. We like to keep test coverage high, so please write unit
tests, and then run them using `npm test`.

Thank you!
